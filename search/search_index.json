The practice was first introduced in 2005 for product development by Jeff Patton in his fantastic book, User Story Mapping.</p> <p>Mapping user stories improves the team\u2019s understanding of the organizational priorities and makes it easier to plan work effectively across sprints (in a Scrum team) and across time (in a Kanban team).</p> <p>This practice enables us to create a dynamic outline of the upcoming marketing efforts and the user\u2019s interactions with each of them through time. Based on our map, we can break down our marketing user stories into actionable work items and plan to execute them when they're likely to make the greatest impact.</p> <p>A user story map consists of two dimensions: vertical and horizontal.</p> <p>The vertical dimension indicates priority. It works similarly to the way we prioritize user stories in a traditional backlog. We place the items with the highest priority on top and arrange them down the line accordingly.</p> <p>The horizontal dimension represents the steps a user takes toward becoming a paying customer based on pivotal moments in their journey, all of which are facilitated by marketing campaigns. A good example of a horizontal dimension of a user story map would be the following path:</p> <p>Become aware of the problem our product/service solves --&gt; Learn about the available solutions --&gt; Compare solutions --&gt; Make a purchase</p> <p>User story mapping can be used as an alternative to traditional backlogs, or as an additional visual tool that boosts their value. By visually mapping our user stories, both horizontally and vertically, we can break the customer journey down into its distinct stages and group activities in a way that will support the timely delivery of value on an internal level.</p> <p>As a result, we can ensure that nothing gets missed when we plan large campaigns that span across a longer timeline.</p> <p>Before proceeding to learn how to apply user story mapping, why don't you take a second to get the most recent State of Agile marketing report?</p>"},{"location":"content/storymapping2.html#applying-user-story-mapping","title":"Applying User Story Mapping","text":"<p>Like backlog management, user story mapping is an ongoing process.

To build a frame that described your context best, consider customer-centric questions like:</p> <p>What problem are we addressing? What are we going to promote with our marketing efforts? Who is the buyer persona we are targeting? What are the benefits of our product/service for the buyer\u2019s persona?
